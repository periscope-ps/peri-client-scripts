This folder contains helper scripts for pulling topologies from
perfSONAR Topology Services (ps_pull.py) and GENI Aggregate 
Managers(am_pull.py). These scripts automatically invoke 'unisencoder' 
and push the converted topology to UNIS instance.


There are two ways to use ps_pull and am_pull. The first approach is to use 
a configuration file (see config.sample).
The second approach is to directly invoke ps_pull.py or am_pull.py with all 
the required parameters (see am_pull.py â€“help for the required parameters).
